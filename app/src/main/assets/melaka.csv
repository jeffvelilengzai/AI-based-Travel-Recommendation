Palsaik Samgyupsal is a very famous dish in South Korea. In fact, from 2012, nearly all tours to South Korea include a meal of Palsaik, and the majority of these meals are enjoyed in the first Palsaik Samgyupsal restaurant ever, making Palsaik Samgyupsal Seoul’s most visited restaurant, and the country’s most successful chain restaurant. In Korean Palsaik means ‘Eight Colours’. Samgyupsal is the Korean word for pork belly. As such Palsaik Samgyupsal means eight coloured belly pork. The eight colours are provided by the marinades in which the pork belly is flavoured with. At Palsaik, the eight flavours are Ginseng, Wine, Pine Needles, Garlic, Herb, Curry, Miso and Gochujang (Korean Red Pepper Paste).

It is generally rich in flavor and thick in texture. As such, our menu is created using the two keywords – richness and thickness. Our key vision is to promote more local specialties to foreigners. We elaborately design our fusion menu using our own local ingredients, such as salted egg chicken and sambal prawn, to serve with pasta. We serve food with kaya as well. Unlike the usual kaya that can be found everywhere, our kaya is especially homemade with duck eggs and Malacca sugar. One of the signature dishes that are served with kaya is “Malacca Elvis”; a pancake stack with sliced banana and kaya sandwiched in between, drizzled with homemade chocolate and peanut butter sauce. We also serve traditional dishes like “Yin Yong Toast” with kaya and butter and “Kaya Cheese Toast”.","Vegetarian Friendly","Vegan Options",,"Juice & Smoothies","Pasta","French Toast","Omelette","Salad","Pancakes","Toasts","Pesto","Cakes","Kaya Toast",,,,,,,,,,,"booking@layanglayangmelaka.com",,"Restaurants",,,"Reservations","Seating","Wine and Beer","Cash Only","Free Wifi","Table Service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asia/Kuala_Lumpur","1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"1140","19:00","540","09:00",,,,,,,,,"7644341","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/88/0c/47/salted-duck-egg-spaghetti.jpg",,"false","false","false","2.196177","32 Jalan Tukang Besi, 75200","en-MY","Kaya Kaya Cafe","Melaka, Central Melaka District, Melaka State","102.248344","Breakfast","Lunch","Brunch","Drinks",,,,"Kaya Kaya Cafe","186",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Open Now",,"+60 6-281 4089","309",,,,,,"$$ - $$$",,"627","14","#14 of 627 Restaurants in Melaka","4.5","2","8","18","51","107","3.816864252090454","2","great food and ambience",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Café",,,,,,"RESTAURANT","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g306997-d7644341-Reviews-Kaya_Kaya_Cafe-Melaka_Central_Melaka_District_Melaka_State.html","http://www.facebook.com/kayakayacafelol/",

It has recently opened its doors in December 2016 after seven years of refurbishment, and the fine work of conservation and restoration will be evident once you step into 5 Heeren. 5 Heeren is a literal 1 minute walk away from the popular Jonker Street, and just a few minutes walk from all the major icons such as The Stadhuys, Malacca River, The Peranakan Museum, etc. This Peranakan Museum Residence (adults only) has 10 guest suites, and uniquely features dressing areas, bathrooms, and private balconies (our river facing suites) as well as a number of personal touches. Aiming to provide a 'home away from home' atmosphere, 5 Heeren is your haven from the city's bustle, and it uniquely captures & celebrates the spirit of this UNESCO World Heritage City and its unique Peranakan culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"info@5heeren.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3.0","This property is classified according to Giata.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9451810","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/af/27/e4/garden-courtyard.jpg",,,,"false","2.19468","5 Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, 75200","en-MY","5 Heeren Museum Residence","Melaka, Central Melaka District, Melaka State","102.24753",,,,,,,,"5 Heeren Museum Residence","218","10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"false",,"639","MYR 640","BookingCom","73","MYR 73","MYR 713","Booking.com","true",,"633","MYR 633","Expedia","64","MYR 65","MYR 698","Expedia.com","false","MYR 818","487","MYR 487","Vio","116","MYR 116","MYR 604","Vio.com",,,,"+60 11-2627 8772","423","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/af/27/e4/garden-courtyard.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/2d/3b/16/opium-pearl.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/af/21/a3/boulevard-suite.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1",,,"$$","MYR 598 - MYR 777","188","1","#1 of 188 hotels in Melaka","5","0","1","4","7","206","4.8046369552612305","16","laksa","10","peranakan culture","8","nyonya kuih","4","grand harbour","2","mille crepe cake","4","cultural experience","31","jonker street","16","the river","10","chicken rice ball","2","living museum","2","breakfast was amazing","2","balcony overlooking","2","big balcony","9","boutique hotel","7","breakfast spread","4","home away from home","5","a great stay","8","walking distance","3","dutch square","54","antiques","17","heritage","20","furniture","6","opium","2","pea","5","baba","4","singapore","3","design","4","attractions","2","eateries",,,"2024-05-18T04:55:42-04:00","951323585","5","951323585","I came in early May which is before the busy season which was very nice.","room_tip",,"2024-05-09T09:55:58-04:00","950174661","5","950174661","A fabulous hotel!

This is the latest and newest backpackers travelers hostel in town. Friendly environment and fairly cheap price for rooms. Rooms availability from Single/Double/Triple Fan / A/C / Attached Bathroom. The best part is the atmosphere here is so laid back and fun, plus the great locality which is near to all sightseeing sites, but not on the main road. So the place is peacefully quiet at all times. Unless the socializing travelers are having a great fun...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2.5","This property is classified according to Giata.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1975837","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/5e/9d/11/travellers-planet-hostel.jpg",,,,"false","2.189942","1-19 Jalan Pm 3, 75000","en-MY","Travellers Planet Hostel","Melaka, Central Melaka District, Melaka State","102.24705",,,,,,,,"Travellers Planet Hostel","178","13",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+60 16-242 6699","65","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5e/9d/11/travellers-planet-hostel.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/bb/82/8f/private-en-suite-deluxe.jpg?w=600&h=-1&s=1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5e/9d/3a/travellers-planet-hostel.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1",,,"$","MYR 57","400","6","#6 of 400 Specialty lodging in Melaka","4.5","3","6","19","57","93","3.556662082672119",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2017-08-02T18:17:02-04:00","508259212","5","508259212","near to citycenter and jonker street","room_tip",,"2016-09-20T01:25:04-04:00","420415862","5","420415862","Rooms 1 and 2 are ground floor - no stairs!
